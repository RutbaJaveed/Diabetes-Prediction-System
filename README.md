# Diabetes Prediction System
This project is a machine learning-based diabetes prediction system built using Support Vector Machine (SVM) on the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset. 
It involves data cleaning, feature scaling, and stratified train-test splitting to ensure balanced evaluation. 
The model achieves over 77% accuracy and predicts whether an individual is diabetic or non-diabetic based on input health metrics.

## Features
